      "grammarTitle": "Demonstratives with Singular and Plural Nouns",
      "detailedExplanation": "Use 'this' for singular nouns close in time/space and 'these' for plural nouns. Since 'cases' is plural, choose 'these'. Tips: read the noun aloud first; if it ends with an -s plural, match with 'these'. Practise by rewriting 10 singular examples into plural.",
