# IELTS Drill Web App

## Overview
This repository contains a single-page web application built with React and Tailwind CSS for practicing English grammar and vocabulary.

### Top-level files
- **`index.html`**: The entire application lives in this file. It includes Tailwind, React, ReactDOM, and Babel via CDN links. All JavaScript, JSX, and styling are embedded directly in the file.
- **`README.md`**: You are reading it.

## Main components and flow
1. **Utility helpers**
   - `normalize`: lowercases, removes punctuation, and standardizes quotes.
   - `levenshtein`: computes edit distance between the student's response and the model answer.
   - `shuffle`: randomizes question order.
2. **Question bank (`BANK`)**
   - An array of objects containing `id`, `category`, `prompt`, acceptable answers, and explanations.
3. **`EnglishDrillApp` React component**
   - Uses React hooks for state management.
   - Functions like `checkAnswer`, `skip`, `next`, and `reshuffle` control question flow.
   - `getBestMatch` calculates "Almost" status when the user's answer is close to correct.

## Important concepts to grasp
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useRef` manage state and side effects.
- **Edit-distance comparison**: The `levenshtein` function powers "almost correct" feedback.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes provide styling without dedicated CSS files.
- **Babel in the browser**: `<script type="text/babel">` enables JSX without a build step.

## Pointers for learning next
- **React basics**: Component structure and JSX syntax.
- **State and prop management**: How state drives the UI and question flow.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Understanding utility-first styling.
- **String-processing algorithms**: A deeper dive into Levenshtein distance and normalization techniques.
- **Modularization and build tools**: Learn about bundlers (Vite, Webpack) and how to break the monolithic `index.html` into separate components for scalability.

## Summary
This project is a small, standalone React application delivered entirely through a single HTML file. It demonstrates how to build an interactive language-drill tool using only CDN-supplied libraries and browser-side Babel. To grow or contribute, focus on mastering React hooks, Tailwindâ€™s styling conventions, and basic algorithmic text processing. From there, the natural next step is learning how to modularize the code and introduce a build process for larger-scale development.
